If you are not following the course but for some reason are reading this page, you can find notes for the course and the exercise sheets on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jackmdavies/teaching?authuser=0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jack‚Äôs webpage</a> or on the eCampus page for the course; the course will start with a brief introduction to \(\infty\)-categories (in the guise of quasi-categories), then introduce spectra and stable homotopy theory, and finally the basics of chromatic homotopy theory.</p> <p>If you are taking the course, submit your solutions to: s6milore@uni-bonn.de. As usual, you need 50% of the points to be admitted to the exam (feel free to ask clarifications about my corrections by email or in person!). Presenting solutions during the seminar is not required for admission to the exam, but warmly encouraged.</p> <p><strong>Public Service Announcement:</strong> Please do tell me before the tutorial if you want to see the solutions to some of the self-study exercises, so that I can prepare them and (time permitting, and it won‚Äôt permit too much tbh) present or sketch them in the tutorial. Similarly, you are encouraged to send by email any question about the material of the course if you think it might be something interesting to discuss in the meeting.</p> <h4 id="tutorial-logbook">Tutorial logbook</h4> <p>I‚Äôll record here what we did during the tutorials and if needed post additional stuff to tie up loose ends.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Zeroth tutorial (18/04/24): A chill affair, we reviewed the basics of simplicial sets and quasi-categories. In the end I had to rush through the proof of simplicial groups being Kan complexes, <a href="/assets/pdf/AT2Tutorial/AT2Tutorial0_Loose_Ends.pdf">here</a> is a write-up of a readable (I hope!) proof.</p> </li> <li> <p>First tutorial (25/04/24): I wasn‚Äôt very well prepared today, sorry for that. In any case, we just corrected the exercises, which everybody smashed anyway, so not much to add. Maybe one small takeaway: when proving adjunctions, it‚Äôs worth trying to reduce them to already known natural bijections.</p> </li> <li> <p>Second tutorial (02/05/24): Small audience today, I hope most people were out enjoying the sun and touching grass (recommended if you are studying homotopy theory<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>). Anyway, a couple of announcements: first, next Thursday is a public holiday so there will be no meeting in person and we will upload a write-up of the solutions instead, second, I wrote <a href="/assets/pdf/AT2Tutorial/AT2Tutorial2_Loose_Ends.pdf">some comments</a> about this week‚Äôs exercises.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third tutorial (no meeting): Sooo‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have an elementary solution of Problem 8, we will upload one later explaining some of the technology one can use to prove this kind of statements, for now you can have a look at the <a href="/assets/pdf/AT2Tutorial/AT2Tutorial3_Partial_Solution.pdf">other exercises</a> at least.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fourth tutorial (16/05/24): Not much to say about this one, the exercises were quite formal, and in fact the takeaway of this week might be precisely that \(\infty\)-categories are great for proving formally stuff that seems like it should be formal. However, I have one <a href="/assets/pdf/AT2Tutorial/AT2Tutorial4_Loose_Ends.pdf">comment</a> about the third exercise: as Praneet correctly pointed out during the tutorial, one still has to make sure that formal arguments actually go through, which can require some care.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fifth tutorial (no meeting): Solutions to the fifth sheet will be uploaded here (at some point‚Ä¶).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sixth tutorial (06/06/24): First tutorial in ages! The Moore spectra exercises were quite challenging, but most groups did well on them, so nothing to add to what we said in the meeting. Math aside, we had a nice time with biscuits and chocolate, if you don‚Äôt come next week you‚Äôre missing out!</p> </li> <li> <p>Seventh tutorial (13/06/24): Wew, this one was a big mess, sorry‚Ä¶ Hopefully I will upload a solution to the second and third exercise here. Exercise 2.3.10 in the notes, which was quite confusing, has been turned into Problem 35 in the ninth sheet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eight tutorial (20/06/24): Not a lot to comment, this sheet was fairly straightforward. The most interesting exercise was the arithmetic fracture square, but it really was just algebra (of some kind), with the only perhaps slighty subtle part being that the \(q\)-completion of a spectrum is \(p\)-acyclic for \(p\neq q\) (it‚Äôs also easy to overlook that one has to prove this‚Ä¶).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ninth tutorial (27/06/24): We had a special guest this time, and I got a bit flustered‚Ä¶ Anyway, at some point I would like to upload an explanation of why the canonical map \(BU(n-1)\rightarrow B(n)\) can be identified with the projection of the sphere bundle of the universal rank \(n\) bundle (this is the sixth of the self-study exercises, it‚Äôs not difficult, but it can be confusing if one is not familiar with classifying spaces), I don‚Äôt promise anything however, because (as it‚Äôs probably clear by the many things I still have to upload) I‚Äôm really grasping for time at the moment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tenth tutorial (04/07/24): It would be nice to write a good solution for the exercise with the Gysin sequence; the other exercises were quite straightforward.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eleventh tutorial (11/07/24): Last tutorial with graded exercises. I called this one off due to low turnout, if you have any questions regarding the exercises feel free to ask.</p> </li> <li> <p>Twelfth tutorial (18/07/24): This one was a review session.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Good luck with the exam üçÄ</p> <p><br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br></p> <hr> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>If you were at the exodromy talk instead, then add ‚Äútouch grass‚Äù to the next exercise sheet.¬†<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> ¬© Copyright 2024 Michele Lorenzi. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?5d75c11f89cd96294bf5e6dd1ee1bb30"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?fcfacfb8c6281f5e68d5a7d348186eb1"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> </body> </html>
